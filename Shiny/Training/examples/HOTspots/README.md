# Welcome to HOTSpots: A tool for tracking antimicrobial resistance

This project is a collaboration between the Menzies School of Health Research and the University of Melbourne.
The aim is to help track the change in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) over space and time. We provide various visualisations of the resistance data to help practitioners and decision-makers in their management. At the time of its launch (July 2021), the data is largely from the Top End of Australia.

## Data and Methodology
Antibiotic susceptibility data have been contributed by four main pathology service providers across three jurisdictions in northern Australia. These are Territory Pathology (Northern Territory), Pathology Queensland, Western Diagnostics (Western Australia and Northern Territory) and PathWest (Western Australia).  

Between pathology providers there were variations in the content and format of the supplied data, requiring a process of data cleaning and standardisation. This is in part due to the variation in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) guidelines used (Northern Territory and Western Australia use CLSI while Queensland used CLSI to 30th  June 2012 and then moved to EUCAST), however it is also due to individual laboratory policies and processes and the availability of antimicrobial agents for testing. For example, Western Diagnostics, PathWest and Territory Pathology all use CLSI, which recommends agents that are important for routine testing against various organisms or organism groups (an antimicrobial panel), however other agents may be tested or reported selectively based on the institution's formulary or substituted with a more practical alternative where their activity is similar. Therefore, the number and type of antimicrobials tested against the same microbes varies between laboratories. The microbes reported also varied, however common pathogens were identified and these microbes are available to select from the dropdown menu.  

Data were harmonised across the three jurisdictions by standardising antimicrobial, microbe and sample type nomenclature. Regions within jurisdictions were based on classification by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Statistical Area Level 3. The healthcare setting was determined by the type of facility at which the sample was collected. Duplicates were removed from the data by selecting the first isolate per person, per calendar year. The percentage of resistant isolates was calculated by dividing the number resistant by the total number of isolates tested. For years with <15 isolates collected and tested, these data (within the region of interest) were added to the following or previous year (or excluded if all 3 years had <15 isolates).  

Territory Pathology provided minimum inhibitory concentrations, to which we applied the 2017 CLSI M100-S27 Performance Standards for AST (27th Edition). All other data were supplied as interpreted values: susceptible (including intermediate) and resistant. Data on age and sex was not available from Territory Pathology and PathWest, and PathWest data was only available by year.
