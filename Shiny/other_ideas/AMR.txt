The remit of the ADILA project pivoted to a sole focus on antibiotic use. However, we have many AMR datasets (such as NARMS CDC and ReLAVRA) and these data could be explored via Shiny apps. If this is to be pursued, make sure the apps are scalable and flexible to facilitate data of different formats.
