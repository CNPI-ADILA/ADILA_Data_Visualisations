# More tabs under development, for integration into Shiny app:

# 1. Summary statistics
  # How many countries/antimicrobials are included in the dataset?
    # number of antimicrobials per category (e.g., Australia has data for 50 antimicrobials, Access category has 40 antimicrobials,)
  # For each category and for each tiered combination (except year): 
    # annual mean/95%CI of standard units/DDD/DID/DI
    # percentage of total (using the sum of the means)

# 2. Predictive models
  # Predict AMC five years into the future/past
